INTRODUCTION
    This CSV Comparison Tool is a Python script designed t ocompare data from two CSV files based on specified criteria. It generates a summary CSV file that displays significant differences between the input files.

REQUIREMENTS:
    Python System

STEPS: 
    Download and install Python
    Ensure that the CSV files you wish to compare are accessible on your computer.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
    Execute the script by typing: 
        Python CSVCompTool.py

INPUT FORMAT:
    The program expects the user input in the following format: 

        source_1_file; source_2_file; ratio; ignore; fileType

            - must be 5 parameters and separated by semicolons

        source_1_file: source 1 file (path if needed)
            format: /path/to/source1.csv
        source_2_file: source 2 file (path if needed) 
            format: /path/to/source2.csv
        ratio: percentage threshold for comparison (0-100 int)
            format: 10
        companies_to_ignore: A list of company names to ignore

        Example Input:
            /path/to/source1.csv;/path/to/source2.csv;10;[Company A, Company B];Summary

OUTPUT
    The program creates a file named target.csv in the same directory as the script. This file contains the comparison summary.
    
    target.csv legend:
        "-" --> difference is less than ratio
        "X" --> difference is greater than ratio
        "I" --> company on ignore list, ignored
        "1" --> company appears only in source 1
        "2" --> company appears only in source 2

ERROR HANDLING
    Invalid CSV files:
        If either of the input files is not a valid CSV, the program will print an error message and exit.
    Incorrect input format:
        If the input format is incorrect, the program will print a guidance message and exit.
    Empty CSV files:
        If either of the CSV files is empty, the program will notify the user and exit.
